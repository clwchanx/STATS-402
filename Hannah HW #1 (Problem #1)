Problem 1:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#importing data/ packages -----
campusclimate <- read.csv("~/Downloads/campusclimate.csv") #Campus Climate data
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)


# HW Problem 1a
scatterplot(academicenvp ~ friendlyenvp, data = campusclimate, 
            main = "scatterplot of friendlyenvp vs. academicenvp")

```


```
Problem 1b:
The lines in this plot show +/- on average how much the data varies from the LSRL,(like the standard deviation of the residuals se(b)?). 
The two box plots show us where most of the data lies. For example, most of the x value are concentrated between 40 to 100 with some low outliers below 40; while most of the y-values are between 20 to 90 with few outliers outsidee of that range. 
```
```{r}
scatterplot(academicenvp ~ friendlyenvp, span=0.5, lwd=3, id.n=4, 
            data=campusclimate, main ="scatterplot of friendlyenvp vs. academicenvp")
```

Problem 1c:
```{r}
ccSubset <- subset(campusclimate, academicenvp >= 10 & friendlyenvp >= 40)
scatterplot(academicenvp ~ friendlyenvp , span=0.5, lwd=3, id.n=4, 
            data=ccSubset, main ="scatterplot of friendlyenvp vs. academicenvp")
```

Problem 1d:
The subset data has a larger slope of ~0.61 and R^2 of 26.44% while the original data had a slope of 0.58 and an R^2 of 26.05%. While both the slope and R^2 increased for the subset model, it was only by a small amount, meaning taking out the lower values/ outliers did not help us to account for much morer variability in our predictions on academicenvp using x = friendlyenvp.
```{r}
originalLm <- lm(academicenvp ~ friendlyenvp, data=campusclimate)
summary(originalLm)

subsetLm <- lm(academicenvp ~ friendlyenvp, data=campusclimate, subset = academicenvp > 10 & friendlyenvp >40)
summary(subsetLm)
```
1e: Interpret the slope, intercepts, and R-squared for model resulting from the subset of the data you created within context 
> (Slope= 0.6078) The subset data's slopes shows us that as friendlyenvp increases by 1 pt, the value for the predicted academicenvp will increase by 0.6 pts. In other words there is a positive relationship between the two variables.
> (Y-intercept = 13.33) If the friendlyenvp is rerported to be 0, then the academicenvp is predicted to be 13.33. This does not necessary make sense to interpret with this model since we subset the data to x> 40, extrapolation?
> (R^2 = 0.2644) We are able to account for 26.44% of the variability in the predicted values of academicenvp using the linear model with x = friendlyenvp. 

1f:Conduct exploratory data analysis by creating the histograms, qqplot, plot of residuals vs. predictor. One quick way to perform exploratory data analysis is to use the common plot(name of the model) function. This will provide you with the majority of the plots we need. 
```{r}
#Residuals Histogram
residuals_data <- data.frame(residuals = subsetLm$residuals)

ggplot(data = residuals_data, aes(x = residuals)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title = 'Histogram of Residuals', x = 'Residuals', y = 'Frequency')

```
```{r}
#Based off example from section
library(car)
hist(rstudent(subsetLm))


```
```{r}
qqPlot(subsetLm, distribution="norm")

# How to plot of residuals vs. predictor?
```

1g:Draw the  and a . Are the different or the same? Explain why they are the same or different? 
```{r}
# plot of residuals vs academicenvp^ (Y^)
ggplot(ccSubset, aes(x = predict(subsetLm) , y = residuals_data$residuals), na.rm = FALSE) +
  geom_point()


```
