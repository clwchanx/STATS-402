#The dashed line in this plot shows that the linear regression line, which shows the best fit straight-line relationship between the two variables,
which means when student have more firend, their academic satisfaction are higher.
#The solid line captures potential non-linear trends in the data. This line indicates that while the overall trend is positive, the relationship might not be perfectly linear.
#What I can conclude from two plots is that it shows a positive linear relationship between happiness and academic satisification.

#After subsetting the data, the scatterplot shows a clearer positive relationship between friendliness and academic satisfaction, with a tighter clustering of data points and less variability 
at lower levels. The removal of lower friendliness and satisfaction scores has made the trend more pronounced,
with the regression line and smoother showing a more consistent upward trend. For me this result is definitely better than b)

#The subset model shows a slightly higher slope and R-squared compared to the original model,indicating that removing the lower 
values of friendliness and academic satisfaction improve the relationship between the two variables. I think the changes are minor, 
showing that the overall relationship remains similar, with friendliness being a  strong predictor of academic satisfaction in both models.

#e)
#The slope in the subset model of 0.59642 suggests that every one-unit increase in perceived friendliness on campus, the student population 
increases in academic satisfaction by approximately 0.60 units; thus, there is a moderate positive relationship between the two variables.
The intercept is 14.28. This gives the predicted academic satisfaction at the lowest level of friendliness, although I know that this value is 
highly theoretical since a score of zero for friendliness may be not true.The 0.261 R-square shows that 26.1% of the variation in academic 
satisfaction is explained by friendliness, which says that friendliness is very important in this case.
